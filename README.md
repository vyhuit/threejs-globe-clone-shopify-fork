# Three.js Globe Clone (Shopify Fork)

A lightweight Three.js + `three-globe` scene that renders an animated flight-style globe, adapted for embedding inside Shopify storefronts or any static host.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npx vite
```
Then open the Vite dev URL (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`) and ensure your HTML contains a `#globe-container` element for the renderer to mount into.

## Documentation
See [`docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for architectural notes, customization hooks (appearance, data, animation), and development tips.
